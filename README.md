<h3>The Slide HTML + CSS: </h3>

<p>This project showcases a banner animation that I designed in Figma and implemented using HTML and CSS. It features responsive design elements to adapt to different devices and browsers, ensuring a seamless user experience across platforms.</p>
<p>I have tailored the code to ensure compatibility with different browsers and devices. This includes using vendor prefixes for CSS properties and media queries for responsive design.</p>

<h3>The Carousel HTML + CSS: </h3>
<p>This code defines the styling and animations for a sponsor section on a web page. The :root selector defines CSS variables for consistent styling across the entire document. The common classes apply general styles to all elements and reset margins and paddings for a consistent layout. The keyframe animation slider-sponsor animates the sponsor images, making them slide smoothly across the screen. The CSS includes various vendor prefixes to ensure compatibility with older browsers and different rendering engines.</p>

<h3>Carousel js: </h3>
<p>This section of the code manages a carousel of items that can be navigated using "Next" and "Previous" buttons. The carousel updates smoothly and adjusts to different screen sizes.</p>
<p>This JavaScript code initializes a carousel with eight items, allowing navigation through "Next" and "Previous" buttons. The nextSlide and prevSlide functions handle the navigation logic, while the updateCarousel function updates the position of each item in the carousel. The carousel is set to automatically advance every 4 seconds and adjust when the window is resized.</p>
<p>This CSS code styles the carousel container and items. It uses Flexbox to center and align the items and includes media queries to adjust the carousel's width for different screen sizes. The CSS also ensures that the carousel items are properly positioned and animated, providing a smooth transition effect.</p>

<h3>Slider Js : </h3>
<p>This project implements a responsive news slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The slider features a series of slides that can be navigated through using next and previous buttons, as well as dot indicators. The slides auto-transition every 7 seconds.</p>
<h4>Features :</h4>
<ul>
        <li>
            Previous and Next buttons allow users to manually cycle through the slides.
        </li>
        <li>
            The slider loops infinitely, wrapping from the last slide back to the first and vice versa.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dot indicators at the bottom of the slider show the current slide.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clicking on a dot navigates directly to the corresponding slide.
        </li>
        <li>
            The slides automatically transition every 7 seconds.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The HTML structure includes a section for the news slider, with each slide having a unique id. The navigation dots are also included in the markup.
