<h3>The Slide HTML + CSS: </h3>

<p>This project showcases a banner animation that I designed in Figma and implemented using HTML and CSS. It features responsive design elements to adapt to different devices and browsers, ensuring a seamless user experience across platforms.</p>
<p>I have tailored the code to ensure compatibility with different browsers and devices. This includes using vendor prefixes for CSS properties and media queries for responsive design.</p>

<h3>The Carousel HTML + CSS: </h3>
<p>This code defines the styling and animations for a sponsor section on a web page. The :root selector defines CSS variables for consistent styling across the entire document. The common classes apply general styles to all elements and reset margins and paddings for a consistent layout. The keyframe animation slider-sponsor animates the sponsor images, making them slide smoothly across the screen. The CSS includes various vendor prefixes to ensure compatibility with older browsers and different rendering engines.</p>
